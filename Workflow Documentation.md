    - Did it work before?
    - Which add-ins are you loading?

- The Entitlement Process refers to the steps when a support case is initially opened to confirm GSD’s service obligations

- customers with existing SAIDs will continue to use their SAIDs until they renew their support. 
- The engineer has the obligation to ask the customer in which region they want to manage the issue and in the case that the customer did not response, the engineer has to handle the case according to the Time Zone Box located in the Contact Tab in Sparks.
